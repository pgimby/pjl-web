Please report any issue experienced with the computers in the computational lab to the network administrator. To aid in fixing the issue please take a few minutes to gather some additional information that will aid in the debugging process. Please include as much information as possible.

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Confirm if the issue is on one machine or multiple.}

If multiple machines are experiencing the same problem, please include the names of at least two machines in the bug report.
	
\item {\bf Confirm if the issue is user specific.}

Ask a second user to attempt the same task, and see if it fails for them as well.

\item {\bf Try and run the affected program from the command console.}
